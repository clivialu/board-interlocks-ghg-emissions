## In plain language

This research investigates whether and how board interlocks — directors who serve on multiple corporate boards — affect companies’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  
We find that interlocked networks allow firms to share sustainability knowledge and practices.  
Companies connected to others with stronger environmental performance tend to reduce their own emissions over time.  
The findings highlight how governance networks can foster the diffusion of environmental responsibility across firms.
