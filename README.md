## In Plain Language

This research investigates whether and how board interlocks, directors who serve on multiple corporate boards affect companies’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  
We find that interlocked networks allow firms to share sustainability knowledge and practices.  
Companies connected to others with stronger environmental performance tend to reduce their own emissions over time.  
The findings highlight how governance networks can foster the diffusion of environmental responsibility across firms.

## Paper Highlight: 

| # | Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---------------|-------------------------|
| **1** | Boards want hard proof that networking pays off. | Across 2,659 S&P 1500 firm-years (2009-2018), a higher count of board interlocks consistently lowers GHG-intensity.|
| **2** | Not all links are equal, variety sparks learning. | Demonstrates that the optimal bundle is a mix of same-industry, cross-industry, and “leader” interlocks rather than any single type. |
| **3** | Heavy emitters need bigger levers. | Shows the interlock–emissions effect is strongest in high-impact sectors |
| **4** | Explains how firms learn. | Identifies three knowledge channels: peer firms, different industries, and best-in-class performers and quantifies each. |
| **5** | Advances resource-dependence theory. | Positions board interlocks as a quasi-cooperative mechanism for capability development in climate strategy, extending prior research.|

### Managerial Takeaways

* **Expand your board’s external reach.** Each additional interlock is linked to lower GHG intensity, treat director networks as an emissions-reduction asset. 
* **Curate a diverse interlock portfolio.** Combine same-sector know-how, fresh cross-sector ideas, and links to top green performers for maximum impact. 
* **Prioritise interlocks in carbon-heavy industries.** The returns to networking are greatest where regulatory and stakeholder pressure is highest. 
* **Seek directors from recognised environmental leaders.** Ties to firms in the top 10 % of GHG performance accelerate best-practice diffusion.   
* **Leverage the board as a knowledge conduit.** Diverse interlocks supply expertise and technology insights that operating teams can translate into concrete abatement projects.
